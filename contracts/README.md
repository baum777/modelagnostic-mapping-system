# Contracts

Canonical machine-readable registries live here.

## Current Surfaces

- `core/contracts/core-registry.json` - canonical neutral skill, tool, and provider registry snapshot
- `core/contracts/provider-capabilities.json` - canonical provider capability matrix used by the registry builder and validator
- `core/contracts/output-contracts.json` - normalized output contracts for the portable skills
- `core/contracts/tool-contracts/catalog.json` - normalized tool contract catalog for the portable core
- `contracts/core-registry.json` and `contracts/provider-capabilities.json` - compatibility mirrors during the migration

## Compatibility Rules

- `docs/tool-contracts/catalog.json` remains the compatibility export for the current Codex-oriented tool catalog.
- `providers/` owns adapter-specific packaging boundaries.
- canonical provider adapters live under `providers/openai-codex/`, `providers/anthropic-claude/`, `providers/qwen-code/`, and `providers/kimi-k2_5/`.
- The registry builder and validator must stay fail-closed if a declared surface is missing.
