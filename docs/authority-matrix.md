# Authority Matrix

Class: canonical.
Use rule: read this as the compact claim/status ledger; use it to separate doc class from enforcement status and to see which surfaces are canonical, operational, derived, or archive.

This file is the canonical authority map for governance, capability, and documentation claims in `codex-workflow-core`.

Status values:

- `implemented`: enforced by an observed script/tool path
- `contract-only`: documented instruction contract without script enforcement
- `planned`: explicitly referenced future surface, not implemented yet
- `missing`: no enforcing surface observed
- `unclear`: conflicting or incomplete authority signals

For documentation surfaces, doc class and enforcement status are different fields. Class says what the doc is; enforcement status says whether a script or validator backs the claim.
For non-document surfaces, doc class is `n/a` and surface kind carries the distinction.
Skill surfaces are classified separately as `shared-exported-skill`, `contract-bound-skill`, or `repo-local-control-skill`.
Tool surfaces in this matrix use `runnable`, `validator-backed`, `helper-only`, `contract-only`, `stub`, or `planned` in the enforcement status column. Documentation surfaces keep their prose/status language.

The generated `.qwen` scaffold is a consumer-local operating overlay. It is not shared-core authority and not a repo-global enforcement plane. The Qwen bootstrap validator checks bootstrap integrity only; it does not assert canonical runtime truth.
