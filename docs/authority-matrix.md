# Authority Matrix

Class: canonical.
Use rule: read this as the compact claim/status ledger; use it to separate doc class from enforcement status and to see which surfaces are canonical, operational, derived, or archive.

This file is the canonical authority map for governance, capability, and documentation claims in `model-agnostic-workflow-system`.

Status values:

- `implemented`: enforced by an observed script/tool path
- `contract-only`: documented instruction contract without script enforcement
- `planned`: explicitly referenced future surface, not implemented yet
- `missing`: no enforcing surface observed
- `unclear`: conflicting or incomplete authority signals

For documentation surfaces, doc class and enforcement status are different fields. Class says what the doc is; enforcement status says whether a script or validator backs the claim.
For non-document surfaces, doc class is `n/a` and surface kind carries the distinction.
Skill surfaces are classified separately as `shared-exported-skill`, `contract-bound-skill`, or `repo-local-control-skill`.
Tool surfaces in this matrix use `runnable`, `validator-backed`, `helper-only`, `contract-only`, `stub`, or `planned` in the enforcement status column. Documentation surfaces keep their prose/status language.

Capability maturity labels used in prose docs are:

- `prose-governed`
- `contract-backed`
- `validator-backed`
- `runtime-implemented`

These labels describe maturity and evidence shape. They do not replace the claim-status values in this matrix.

The generated `.qwen` scaffold is a consumer-local operating overlay. It is not shared-core authority and not a repo-global enforcement plane. The Qwen bootstrap validator checks bootstrap integrity only; it does not assert canonical runtime truth.

## Extension Module Consolidation Snapshot

| module | canonical surface(s) | maturity | opt-in posture | eval status | runtime status | deferred cross-module checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OBS | `core/contracts/observability-spine.json` | `contract-backed` | opt-in via `portable-skill-manifest` moduleContracts | validator-backed candidate via `eval:obs` | Phase 1 local dry-run artifact writer | none in current slice |
| PBC | `core/contracts/permission-boundary.json` | `contract-backed` | opt-in via `portable-skill-manifest` moduleContracts | validator-backed candidate via `eval:pbc` | Phase 1 local dry-run permission gate | `PBC-V03` |
| WMC | `core/contracts/workflow-memory-contract.json` | `contract-backed` | opt-in via `portable-skill-manifest` moduleContracts | validator-backed candidate via `eval:wmc` | Phase 3 controlled runtime JSONL writes only | `WMC-V04` |
| MAHP | `core/contracts/handoff-protocol.json`, `core/contracts/handoff-patterns.json` | `contract-backed` | opt-in via `portable-skill-manifest` moduleContracts | validator-backed candidate via `eval:mahp` | Phase 5 local handoff envelope write/read only | `MAHP-V05` |
| RGC | `core/contracts/resource-governor.json` | `contract-backed` | opt-in via `portable-skill-manifest` moduleContracts | validator-backed candidate via `eval:rgc` | Phase 5 local timeout/budget/cancellation checks only | `RGC-V01`, `RGC-V02`, `RGC-V03` |
| TSC | `core/contracts/trigger-scheduling.json` | `contract-backed` | opt-in via `portable-skill-manifest` moduleContracts | validator-backed candidate via `eval:tsc` | Phase 6 explicit local manual trigger artifact plus cron declaration validation only | `TSC-V05`, `TSC-V06` |

Runtime/enforcement note: Phase 1 adds a local dry-run runtime surface for OBS artifact writing and a PBC deny-by-default permission gate. Phase 3 adds controlled runtime-scoped JSONL memory writes with run-artifact provenance and secret/scope blocking. Phase 5 adds local handoff envelope write/read plus timeout, budget, and cancellation checks. Phase 6 adds explicit local manual trigger artifacts and cron declaration validation only. Scheduler daemon, auto-start scheduling, background jobs, handoff transport/receiver, HTTP service, MCP server, remote queue, SQLite, remote memory, and canonical promotion remain deferred.
