# UI/UX Composition Bundle

Class: derived.
Use rule: this bundle is advisory internal branch taxonomy. It supports the canonical charter at [../ui-ux-composition-branch.md](../ui-ux-composition-branch.md) and does not create a second authority path.

## Purpose

This bundle organizes the branch into readable internal layers for composition, policies, modes, routing, modules, examples, and tests.

## Branch Rule

- Canonical truth lives in the branch charter and shared-core authority docs.
- The module docs are advisory and internal.
- Tool contracts remain contract-only until a real runtime surface exists.
- Semantic-design outputs stay deterministic where tooling exists (`scripts/tools` semantic-design commands).
- Render/accessibility verification outputs are deterministic in certification mode and advisory only in operator-evidence mode.
- Golden-ratio guidance is bounded and subordinate to semantic clarity, accessibility, responsiveness, and readability.
- Rendering posture decisions (`static` vs server-rendered dynamic vs hydration) are outside this bundle and belong to `static-vs-dynamic-rendering-advisor`.
