# Core Contracts

Canonical machine-readable contracts for the portable slice.

## Canonical Files

- `core/contracts/portable-skill-manifest.json`
- `core/contracts/output-contracts.json`
- `core/contracts/tool-contracts/catalog.json`
- `core/contracts/provider-capabilities.json`
- `core/contracts/core-registry.json`
- `core/contracts/workflow-routing-map.json`
- `core/contracts/observability-spine.json`
- `core/contracts/permission-boundary.json`
- `core/contracts/workflow-memory-contract.json`
- `core/contracts/handoff-protocol.json`
- `core/contracts/handoff-patterns.json`

Execution evidence and certification artifact contracts are defined in `core/contracts/output-contracts.json`.

`core/contracts/observability-spine.json` is the canonical provider-neutral OBS contract surface for Phase-10 extension adoption and is currently `contract-backed` (validator/runtime wiring deferred).
`core/contracts/permission-boundary.json` is the canonical provider-neutral PBC claim surface and is currently `contract-backed` (validator/runtime wiring deferred).
`core/contracts/workflow-memory-contract.json` is the canonical provider-neutral WMC claim surface and is currently `contract-backed` (validator/runtime wiring deferred).
`core/contracts/handoff-protocol.json` and `core/contracts/handoff-patterns.json` are the canonical provider-neutral MAHP surfaces and are currently `contract-backed`; they define no transport, queueing, retries, or authorization engine.
MAHP is adjacent to OBS, PBC, and WMC contract surfaces only. This slice does not add runtime orchestration across those modules.
Validator-backed candidate eval slices now exist for targeted contract-rule checks (`eval:obs`, `eval:pbc`, `eval:wmc`) and remain opt-in module checks; runtime implementation is still deferred.
`eval:mahp` is a minimal validator-backed candidate slice for core envelope-rule checks only and does not introduce runtime handoff orchestration.

## Safe Extension Flow

1. Update canonical contract(s) in this folder first.
2. Regenerate derived artifacts with `npm run build-registry` and, when needed, `npm run build-exports`.
3. Validate with `npm run validate`, `npm run validate-neutral`, and `npm run eval`.
4. Only then update operational docs/templates/examples that reference changed fields.

## Compatibility Rule

- top-level `contracts/core-registry.json` and `contracts/provider-capabilities.json` are compatibility mirrors while migration is underway.
- `docs/tool-contracts/catalog.json` remains compatibility/export for the legacy tool catalog view.
- compatibility/export mirrors must not introduce canonical-only semantics absent from `core/contracts/*`.

## Maturity Posture

- `prose-governed`: this index and extension guidance.
- `contract-backed`: JSON contracts in this directory.
- `validator-backed`: `scripts/tools/validate-provider-neutral-core.mjs` and `scripts/tools/validate-shared-core-scaffold.mjs`.
- `runtime-implemented`: limited to build/validation scripts that consume and project these contracts.
