# Post-Implementation Review Writer

## Trigger

Use this skill after a change is implemented and verified, or when a handoff needs an operator summary.

## When Not To Use

- Do not use before the change exists.
- Do not use to replace a real test or gate result.
- Do not use to inflate confidence without evidence.

## Workflow

1. Read the diff, tests, and any gate output.
2. Summarize what changed and why.
3. Identify residual risks and follow-up work.
4. Record rollback notes and verification evidence.
5. Keep the review concise and action-oriented.

## Local Inputs

- diff summary or patch
- gate output
- test evidence
- rollback notes

## Output

Use these headings:

- `SUMMARY`
- `FINDINGS`
- `RISKS`
- `TESTS`
- `ROLLBACK`
- `FOLLOW-UP`

## Quality Checks

- Stay grounded in actual changes and evidence.
- Call out missing verification directly.
- Mention rollback paths explicitly.
- Keep the summary suitable for a PR or handoff note.
