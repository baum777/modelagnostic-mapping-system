# Release Narrative Builder

## Trigger

Use this skill when a change needs a stakeholder-friendly release or handover summary.

## When Not To Use

- Do not use before the change is real.
- Do not use to speculate about value without evidence.
- Do not use to replace a review or test summary.

## Workflow

1. Read the actual change summary and supporting evidence.
2. Translate the work into a short narrative for operators or stakeholders.
3. Highlight user-facing or workflow-facing changes first.
4. Note operational follow-up if any.
5. Keep the output concise and grounded.

## Local Inputs

- change summary
- evidence of verification
- target audience or distribution context
- any rollback note that should be visible

## Output

Use these headings:

- `SUMMARY`
- `RELEASE NOTES`
- `HIGHLIGHTS`
- `OPERATIONAL NOTES`
- `FOLLOW-UP`

## Quality Checks

- Keep the language plain and user-facing.
- Mention only changes that actually landed.
- Include operational notes when rollout or support needs attention.
